# Newsmine
Self-taught news recommendation project to learn machine learning and natural language processing.
I am developing a [Newsreveal](https://www.facebook.com/newsreveal/), facebook messenger bot, and [Newsmine](osslab.github.io/newsmine) using knowledges what I studyed through this project.
This project is on going.

### NLP Basics
- [x] [Create Word2Vec model using Korean news article](https://github.com/suhongs/newsmine/blob/master/src/CreateModelusingWord2Vec.ipynb)
- [x] [Visualize Word2Vec model](https://github.com/suhongs/newsmine/blob/master/src/VisualizeWord2Vec.ipynb)
- [x] [News Trends in facebook news share](https://github.com/suhongs/newsmine/blob/master/src/report_2016.ipynb)

### NLP Machine Learning
- [x] [Korean baseball news classification based on team names](https://github.com/suhongs/newsmine/blob/master/src/baseball%20news%20classification.ipynb)
- [x] [Predict youtube feed category using baseball news classification model](https://github.com/suhongs/newsmine/blob/master/src/predict%20youtube%20feed%20using%20svm%20model.ipynb)
- [ ] News Classification all the category(Data is preparing)
- [ ] News recommendation by news section using facebook share counts

You can run jupyter codes in this repository if you build docker image using Dockerfile.
Data will be provided in the near future.
